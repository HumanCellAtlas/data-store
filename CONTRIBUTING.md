# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions to HCA working group repos are subject to overall HCA
governance and technical guidance. In addition, contributors are
expected to abide by the following guidelines:

1. Rough consensus and running code: instead of formal procedures for
   agreeing on everything, systems with working prototypes and existing
   users are prioritized as platforms for discussion.

1. Keep it simple: prioritize scalability and the ability to keep the
   project easy to understand and scale over features. Use
   well-supported upstream solutions where possible. Provide useful
   defaults and don't expose unnecessary configuration options.

1. Separation of concerns and layers: (TODO: elaborate)

1. Don't break the build: pull requests are expected to pass all
   automated CI checks.

1. Keep the build simple: Automated CI checks that are fragile or don't
   serve a clear agreed upon purpose will be removed.

1. All Pull Request comments must be addressed, even after merge.

1. All code must be reviewed by at least 1 other team member.

1. All pull requests relating to an issue must include "connected to 
   \#123", where \#123 is the issue number.

1. Individual commit messages should clearly express the commit's purpose.
