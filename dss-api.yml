    # HTTP semantics

    The DSS API requires clients to follow certain HTTP protocol semantics that may require extra configuration in your
    HTTP client. The reference CLI and SDK (https://hca.readthedocs.io/) is pre-configured to do this. If writing your own
    client, please note the following:


    **301 redirects**: Some DSS API routes may return one or more HTTP 301 redirects, including potentially redirects to
    themselves (combined with the **Retry-After** delay described below). The client must follow these redirects to obtain
    the resource requested.


    **Retry-After header**: Some DSS API routes may use the **Retry-After** header in combination with HTTP 301 or 500
    series response codes. The client must follow the HTTP specification and wait the designated time period before
    continuing with the next request.


    **General retry logic**: If you are building an application that will issue high numbers of API requests, you should be
    prepared for the possibility that a small fraction of requests fails due to network or server errors. In these
    situations, the HTTP client should follow best practice HTTP retry semantics. For example, clients may be configured
    to retry 5 times while waiting for an exponential number of seconds (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 seconds) upon encountering any 500
    series response code, connect or read timeout.


    The following Python code demonstrates an example configuration of the popular Requests library per the above guidance:

    ```

    import requests, requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry

    class RetryPolicy(requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry.Retry):
        def __init__(self, retry_after_status_codes={301}, **kwargs):
            super(RetryPolicy, self).__init__(**kwargs)
            self.RETRY_AFTER_STATUS_CODES = frozenset(retry_after_status_codes | retry.Retry.RETRY_AFTER_STATUS_CODES)

    retry_policy = RetryPolicy(read=5, status=5, status_forcelist=frozenset({500, 502, 503, 504}))

    s = requests.Session()

    a = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry_policy)

    s.mount('https://', a)

    print(s.get("https://dss.data.humancellatlas.org").content)

    ```

    # Subscriptions

    DSS supports webhook subscriptions for data events like bundle creation and deletion. Webhooks are callbacks to a public
    HTTPS endpoint provided by your application. When an event matching your subscription occurs, DSS will send a push
    notification (via an HTTPS POST or PUT request), giving your application an up-to-date stream of system activity.

    Subscriptions are delivered with the payload format

    ```

    {
      'transaction_id': {uuid},
      'subscription_id': {uuid},
      'event_type': "CREATE"|"TOMBSTONE"|"DELETE",  # JMESPath subscriptions only
      'match': {
        'bundle_uuid': {uuid},
        'bundle_version': {version},
      }
      'jmespath_query': {jmespath_query},  # JMESPath subscriptions only
      'es_query': {es_query},  # Elasticsearch subscriptions only
      'attachments': {
        "attachment_name_1": {value},
        "attachment_name_1": {value},
        ...
        "_errors": [...]
      }
    }

    ```


    # Special String Formats

    **DSS_VERSION**: a timestamp that generally follows [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6)
    format guide. However there are a few differences. DSS_VERSION must always be in UTC time, ':' are removed from
    the time, and the fractional seconds extends to 6 decimal places. Using the first example found [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8),
    the RFC3339 version would be `1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z` while the DSS_VERSION would be `1985-04-12T232050.520000Z`

    # Pagination

    The DSS API supports pagination in a manner consistent with the
    [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/traversing-with-pagination/),
    which is based on [RFC 5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). When the results of an API call exceed the
    page size specified, the HTTP response will contain a `Link` header of the following form:
    `Link: <https://dss.data.humancellatlas.org/v1/search?replica=aws&per_page=100&search_after=123>; rel="next"`.
    The URL in the header refers to the next page of the results to be fetched; if no `Link rel="next"` URL is
    included, then all results have been fetched. The client should recognize and parse the `Link` header
    appropriately according to RFC 5988, and retrieve the next page if requested by the user, or if all results
    are being retrieved.

        # Index design

        The metadata seach index is implemented as a
        [document-oriented database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database)
        using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/). The index stores all information relevant to a bundle within
        each bundle document, largely eliminating the need for
        [object-relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). This design is optimized
        for queries that filter the data.


        To illustrate this concept, say our index stored information on three entities, `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`. A foo
        can have many bars and bars can have many bazes. If we were to index bazes in a document-oriented design, the
        information on the foo a bar comes from and the bazes it contains are combined into a single document. A
        example sketch of this is shown below in [JSON-schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSON_Schema).

        ```

        {
          "definitions": {
            "bar": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "uuid": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "format": "uuid"
                },
                "foo": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "uuid": {
                      "type": "string",
                      "format": "uuid"
                    },
                    ...
                  }
                },
                "bazes": {
                  "type": "array",
                  "items": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "format": "uuid"
                  }
                },
                ...
              }
            }
          }
        }

        ```

        This closely resembles the structure of DSS bundle documents: projects have many bundles and bundles have many
        files. Each bundle document is a concatenation of the metadata on the project it belongs to and the files it
        contains.

        # Limitations to index design

        There are limitations to the design of DSS's metadata search index. A few important ones are listed below.

        * [Joins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)) between bundle metadata must be conducted client-side

        * Querying is schema-specific; fields or values changed between schema version will break queries that use
        those fields and values

        * A new search index must be built for each schema version

        * A lot of metadata is duplicated between documents

      description: >
        Create a new version of a file with a given UUID. The contents of the file are provided by the client by
        reference using a cloud object storage URL. The file on the cloud object storage service must have metadata set
        listing the file checksums and content-type.

        The metadata fields required are:

        - hca-dss-sha256: SHA-256 checksum of the file

        - hca-dss-sha1: SHA-1 checksum of the file

        - hca-dss-s3_etag: S3 ETAG checksum of the file.  See https://stackoverflow.com/q/12186993 for the
        general algorithm for how checksum is calculated.  For files smaller than 64MB, this is the MD5 checksum
        of the file.  For files larger than 64MB but smaller than 640,000MB, we use 64MB chunks.  For files larger than
        640,000MB, we use a chunk size equal to the total file size divided by 10000, rounded up to the nearest MB.
        MB, in this section, refers to 1,048,576 bytes.  Note that 640,000MB is not the same as 640GB!

                  If a general error occurs during the processing of attachments, the notification will be sent with
                  `attachments` containing only the reserved `_errors` attachment containing a string describing the
                  error. If an error occurs during the processing of a specific attachment, the notification will be
                  sent with all successfully processed attachments and additionally the `_errors` attachment containing
                  an object with one property for each failed attachment. For example,

                  ```

                  "attachments": {
                    "taxon": [9606, 9606]
                    "_errors" {
                      "biomaterial": "Some error occurred"
                    }
                  }

                  ```

                  The value of the `attachments` property must be less than or equal to 128 KiB in size when serialized
                  to JSON and encoded as UTF-8. If it is not, the notification will be sent with

                  "attachments": {

          ```

          payload. Each attachment will be a child property of the `attachments` property of the payload. The
          name of such a child property can be chosen freely provided it does not start with an underscore.

          For example, if the subscription is

          ```

          {
            "attachments": {
              "taxon": {

              }
            }
          }

          ```

          the corresponding notification payload will contain the following entry

          ```

          "attachments": {
            "taxon": [9606, 9606]
          }

          ```

          If a general error occurs during the processing of attachments, the notification will be sent with
          `attachments` containing only the reserved `_errors` attachment containing a string describing the
          error. If an error occurs during the processing of a specific attachment, the notification will be
          sent with all successfully processed attachments and additionally the `_errors` attachment containing
          an object with one property for each failed attachment. For example,

          ```

          "attachments": {
            "taxon": [9606, 9606]
            "_errors" {
              "biomaterial": "Some error occurred"
            }
          }

          ```

          The value of the `attachments` property must be less than or equal to 128 KiB in size when serialized
          to JSON and encoded as UTF-8. If it is not, the notification will be sent with

          ```

          "attachments": {
            "_errors": "Attachments too large (131073 bytes)"
