        **Pagination**

        The DSS API supports pagination in a manner consistent with the
        [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/traversing-with-pagination/), which is based on
        [RFC 5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). When the results of an API call exceed the page size
        specified, the HTTP response will contain a `Link` header of the following form:
        `Link: <https://dss.data.humancellatlas.org/v1/search?replica=aws&per_page=100&_scroll_id=123>; rel="next"`.
        The URL in the header refers to the next page of the results to be fetched; if no `Link rel="next"` URL is
        included, then all results have been fetched. The client should recognize and parse the `Link` header
        appropriately according to RFC 5988, and retrieve the next page if requested by the user, or if all results
        are being retrieved.

      description: |
        Create a new version of a file with a given UUID. The contents of the file are provided by the client by
        reference using a cloud object storage URL. The file on the cloud object storage service must have metadata set
        listing the file checksums and content-type.

        The metadata fields required are:

        - hca-dss-sha256: SHA-256 checksum of the file
        - hca-dss-sha1: SHA-1 checksum of the file
        - hca-dss-s3_etag: S3 ETAG checksum of the file.  See
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12186993/what-is-the-algorithm-to-compute-the-amazon-s3-etag-for-a-file-larger-than-5gb
        for the general algorithm for how checksum is calculated.  For files smaller than 64MB, this is the MD5 checksum
        of the file.  For files larger than 64MB but smaller than 640,000MB, we use 64MB chunks.  For files larger than
        640,000MB, we use a chunk size equal to the total file size divided by 10000, rounded up to the nearest MB.
        MB, in this section, refers to 1,048,576 bytes.  Note that 640,000MB is not the same as 640GB!

                  The set of bundle metadata items to be included in the payload of a notification request to a
                  subscription endpoint. Each property in this object represents an attachment to the notification
                  payload. Each attachment will be a child property of the `attachments` property of the payload. The
                  name of such a child property can be chosen freely provided it does not start with an underscore.

                  For example, if the subscription is

                  ```
                  {
                    "attachments": {
                      "taxon": {
                        "type": "jmespath",
                        "expression": "files.biomaterial_json.biomaterials[].content.biomaterial_core.ncbi_taxon_id[]"
                      }
                    }
                  }
                  ```

                  the corresponding notification payload will contain the following entry

                  ```
                  "attachements": {
                    "taxon": [9606, 9606]
                  }
                  ```

                  If a general error occurs during the processing of attachments, the notification will be sent with
                  `attachments` containing only the reserved `_errors` attachment containing a string describing the
                  error. If an error occurs during the processing of a specific attachement, the notification will be
                  sent with all successfully processed attachments and additionally the `_errors` attachment containing
                  an object with one property for each failed attachment. For example,

                  ```
                  "attachements": {
                    "taxon": [9606, 9606]
                    "_errors" {
                      "biomaterial": "Some error occurred"
                    }
                  }
                  ```

                  The value of the `attachments` property must be less than or equal to 128 KiB in size when serialized
                  to JSON and encoded as UTF-8. If it is not, the notification will be sent with

                  "attachements": {
                    "_errors": "Attachments too large (131073 bytes)"

            and a corresponding value. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578 for details on this encoding.
            The actual notification payload will be placed as JSON into a field of the name specified via

          this property set to `{"foo" : "bar"}`, the corresponding notification HTTP request body will be

          ```
          --2769baffc4f24cbc83ced26aa0c2f712
          Content-Disposition: form-data; name="foo"

          payload. Each attachment will be a child property of the `attachments` property of the payload. The
          name of such a child property can be chosen freely provided it does not start with an underscore.

          For example, if the subscription is

          ```
          {
            "attachments": {
              "taxon": {
                "type": "jmespath",

              }
            }
          }
          ```

          the corresponding notification payload will contain the following entry

          ```
          "attachements": {
            "taxon": [9606, 9606]
          }
          ```

          If a general error occurs during the processing of attachments, the notification will be sent with
          `attachments` containing only the reserved `_errors` attachment containing a string describing the
          error. If an error occurs during the processing of a specific attachement, the notification will be
          sent with all successfully processed attachments and additionally the `_errors` attachment containing
          an object with one property for each failed attachment. For example,

          ```
          "attachements": {
            "taxon": [9606, 9606]
            "_errors" {
              "biomaterial": "Some error occurred"
            }
          }
          ```

          The value of the `attachments` property must be less than or equal to 128 KiB in size when serialized
          to JSON and encoded as UTF-8. If it is not, the notification will be sent with

          "attachements": {
